We have developed a python code from scratch, that detects cars from images and videos. It can also extract data from their number plates. 
The whole project was createdd, tried and tested on the basis of handling and managing security threats that might impose on facilities of Government and the defence 
containing sensitive information.
The vision behind such a system was to keep measures as simple and cost efficient, where the software would take real time frames from the security camera feed as input, and serve continous detection of number plates 
and store them in a database, keep record of howmany cars/vehicles entered or left the premises on a daily basis.
