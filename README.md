We have developed a software, that detects cars from images and videos in the very basic sense of the purpose. It can also extract data from their number plates. 
The whole project was createdd, tried and tested on the basis of handling and managing security threats that might impose on facilities of Government and the defence 
containing sensitive information.
The vision behind such a system was to keep measures as simple and cost efficient, where the software would take real time frames from the security camera feed as input, and serve continous detection of number plates 
and store them in a database, keep record of howmany cars/vehicles entered or left the premises on a daily basis.
The project was made on OpenCV framework and car HAAR cascades, to identify basic distinguishable features of cars. The                                          [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/tree/master/easyocr) framework helped extract the numbers and text from cars and viewing them seperately. Alongside,
other libraries as in Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn have also been put to use.
